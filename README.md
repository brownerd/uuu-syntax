Make the syntax-theme UUU want.

Just watch this [video]()

## Installation/Dependencies
- Install [uuu-syntax]() and activate it
- Install [uuu-ui]() and activate it
- Install [uuu]() and activate it
- Install [uuu-language-files]()

- Click on the gear icon to access settings for uuu-syntax
- Style away!


## Usage
1. Download [uuu language files]()
1. Open this project in Atom
1. Enable "dev mode". Goto View > Developer > Open In Dev Mode. This will enable live reloading. *You don't need to use Dev Mode. If you don't you will need to Reload the page manualy*
1. Goto Settings > Themes and click on the gear icon to access settings for uuu-syntax
1. Just start at the top of the settings and work your way down. Make one change, and then check it out.


## Issues
If your style doesn't show, or it if looks like all the styles reverted to the default, then just "reload" the window. You can do this in one of three ways:

- Goto View > Developer > Reload Window
- Or open the command palette `shift+cmd+P`, type `reload` and press enter


## Import/Export
At some point you will want to export, import and save your cool, clever and quickly made syntaxes. You will need [uuu]() installed. Follow instructions there for exporting and importing.

## Notes:
uuu-UI, lets you modify just about everything that it can. However, it can't cover EVERY possible plugin that you are using.


## Issues/Requests
If there is a special case that you need, then let me know. I can't promise that I can make an update, but I will look at the ticket and respond.
